Hello, hello, hello! This is a list of the main player characters in Driving Nowhere Deadly, including pictures!

Our wonderful adorable lil mascot is Dicon, he doesn't really have anything to do with any story (yet) but he was drawn as an icon and then we all fell in love.

Candoran, the buffest of them all, was literally banned from his home village because he was too buff. that's it, no ulterior reason, he was just... too buff. Read more about him [here](/characters/candoran).
