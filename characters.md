Hello, hello, hello! would you like to meet our lovely characters! well, if not then you don't wanna be here, but if you do, this sure is the place! as soon as i'm willing to type all that out, that is eheheh,,,

Our wonderful adorable lil mascot is Dicon, he's got nuthin to do with any story (yet) but he was drawn as an icon and then we all fell in love.

## Now, for our main trio of characters: Paz, Fitz, and Candoran.

![To Paz](/img/paz.png)
[To Paz](/characters/to_paz), commonly known as Paz and our resident green dragonborn, is the only son in a family of 32. He has 29 sisters.

![Fitz](/img/fitz.png)
Fitz, twin cousin to Paz, is a blue dragonborn who has a penchant for zapping others. Spencer took over playing her after a few episodes.

![Candoran](/img/candoran.png)
Candoran, the buffest of them all, was literally banned from his home village because he was too buff. that's it, no ulterior reason, he was just... too buff.
