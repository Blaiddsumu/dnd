Welcome to Driving Nowhere Deadly! This is a podcast where a couple teenagers try and figure out a simple roleplaying game, and it got way out of hand.

"It got way out of hand," can also be phrased as "we completely forgot the testing-the-game part and ended up just messing around. also, there are new people."

Special thanks to Richard (not the cat) for editing the first few episodes for us! we're SUPER grateful for all your help.
