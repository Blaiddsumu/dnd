Welcome to Driving Nowhere Deadly! This is a podcast where some teenagers didn't know how to play Dungeons and Dragons but wanted to do it anyways, so they ended up making their own "simplified" (read: completely broken) version of the game and it all got way out of hand.

The main voices of this podcast are Fae, Chelsey, Thomas, and Spencer (who showed up later), residents of our beloved Young Adult-hood state. We're a bunch of amateurs, but that sure as heck isn't stopping us. Fae is the GM, or DI (Driving Instructor, as Chelsey so lovingly says), and Chelsey, Tom, and Spencer play as characters in the game.

Additional voices are Cali, Shayla, and Abbey. They occasionally show up and play as guests.

A HUGE thanks to Richard (Human Richard, not the character in the podcast Richard), who helped a bunch with editing the first few episodes.

Anyways, we hope you enjoy this weird podcast!
#### good luck
