Welcome to Driving Nowhere Deadly! This is a podcast where a couple teenagers try and figure out a simple roleplaying game, and it got way out of hand.

The main voices of this podcast are Fae, Chelsey, Thomas, and Spencer (who showed up laterâ€¦).

Additional voices are Cali, Shayla, and Abbey. They occasionally play as guests.

A HUGE thanks to Richard (NOT the cat, although we do love the cat), who helped a bunch with the first few episodes.

anyways, we hope you enjoy this weird podcast!

(We've also got a Discord server -- more info [here](https://dnd.cold.org/discord/))
