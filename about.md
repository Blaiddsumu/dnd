Welcome to Driving Nowhere Deadly! This is a podcast where a couple teenagers try and figure out a simple roleplaying game, and it got way out of hand.

The voices of this podcast are Fae, also known as the "Driving Instructor" (cough cough the Game Master), who played Fitz the first few episodes, Chelsey, our wonderful player of the legendary To Paz, Tom, the player of the Strongest elf Candoran (literally -- do not get in the way of his muscles), and Spencer, who joined us later...

Additional voices are Cali, who plays Ariel (a character from the Order of Le Cronch, and comes from another dimension), Shayla, who plays Arlo (also from the Order of Le Cronch, same dimension as Ariel), and Zee (or Abbey), who plays Tulari. They occasionally show up as guests. :)

A HUGE thanks to Richard (NOT the cat, although we do love the cat), who helped a bunch with the first few episodes.

anyways, we hope you enjoy this weird podcast!

(We've also got a Discord server -- more info [here](http://localhost:4000/discord/))
