Woah! we've got a Discord server!

you may be wondering "What on earth is Discord, ya weirdo???"

Well! you can learn all about it at the website, [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/), or you can have me tell you about it: it's a cool chat website with a heckton of neat features, like custom emojis and as many different channels as you want in a server.

Here's the widget, I think?? ?? ?  ?
