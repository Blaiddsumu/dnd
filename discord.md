Woah! We've got a Discord server!

Now, I understand how some of you may be wondering "What on earth is Discord, ya weirdo?!?"

Well! you can learn all about it at the website, [discordapp.com](https://discordapp.com/), or you can have me tell you about it: it's a cool chat platform with a lot of neat features, like custom emojis, text AND voice chat channels, and all sorts of other cool stuff. (It's like Slack, but for Gamers)

Here's the widget, if you so wish to join our ranks:
