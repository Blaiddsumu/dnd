Fitz is a blue dragonborn. She lived in the mountains with her family before she moved out and began adventuring. Her mother is the twin sister to Paz's mother, which is why she and Paz are called "twin cousins" (despite being born several years apart.)

Her father is a silver dragonborn, which is why her family lives in the high mountains.
