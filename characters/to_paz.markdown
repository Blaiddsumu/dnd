To Paz goes by his last name, Paz, and is the only son in a family of 32. He is the twin cousin to Fitz, as in their mothers are twins. He has 29 sisters, all of which have varying levels of annoying-ness.

He loves animals, and is likely to adopt one as a pet no matter how dangerous or currently-attacking-him it is. It's quite a problem.

He is a rogue, despite the fact he's like, seven feet tall. He hasn't found much to steal yet, though.

His best friend/favorite pet/party member is Richard, a giant cat he found in the first episode. The cat was not giant when our heroes first found him, but he is giant now.
